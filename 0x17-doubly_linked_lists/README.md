### Doubly linked lists in C programming language
These can be described as data structures that have a sequence of elements known as nodes and each node contains two pointers as compared to the single linked lists with only one pointer. One of the pointers in a double linked list points to the next node in the sequence and the other points to the previous node thus allowing traversal backward and foward

#### General Requirements
- The allowed editors are emacs, vi and vim
- There should not be more than 5 functions in a file
- Your files should end with a new line
- Not allowed to use global variables
- There should be a README.md file at the root of the folder in the project being worked on
- The codes you create should use the betty style
- Do not forget to push your header file

#### Tasks
- function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
- function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
- function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
- function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
- function that frees a dlistint_t list.
- function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
- function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
- function that inserts a new node at a given position.
- function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
